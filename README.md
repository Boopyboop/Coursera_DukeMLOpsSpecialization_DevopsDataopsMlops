# DevOps, DataOps, MLOps – Duke University Coursera

>  **This repository is my personal workspace for experimenting with the code and concepts taught in the course**

##  What I'm Exploring

This course covers modern practices for integrating DevOps principles into data workflows (DataOps) and machine learning lifecycles (MLOps).  
Through multiple modules, I’ll explore:

- CI/CD for data pipelines and ML models  
- Automation of ML workflows  
- Version control for datasets and models  
- Monitoring, deployment, and scaling in production

Each module will have **its own folder**, containing:

- A `README.md` explaining the module’s goals and work
- A `requirements.txt` with dependencies for that module
- Relevant scripts, notebooks, and configs

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-dataops-mlops-duke.git
cd devops-dataops-mlops-duke
````

### 2. Navigate to a Module Folder

Example for Module 1:

```bash
cd module-1
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
